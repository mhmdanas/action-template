**IMPORTANT**: this repository is archived. You cannot open any issues, PRs, or contribute in any way. You can only fork and star (why bother though?) the repo. I originally made this for use in NewPipe's repo, but then I found it to be unnecessary, so I'm not going to work on or maintain this anymore.
